Supervised Learning 
1. What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns a mapping from input features (X) to known output labels (y) using labeled training data.

Goal: Learn a function

f(X)→y

📌 Key idea: The correct answer is already known during training.

2. Types of Supervised Learning
1️⃣ Classification

Predicts discrete / categorical outputs.

Examples:

Spam vs Not Spam

Disease vs No Disease

Fraud vs Non-fraud

Common algorithms:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Neural Networks

2️⃣ Regression

Predicts continuous numerical values.

Examples:

House price prediction

Temperature forecasting

Salary prediction

Common algorithms:

3. Key Components of Supervised Learning
1️⃣ Dataset

A labeled dataset consists of:

Features (X) → independent variables

Target (y) → dependent variable (label)

Example:

Size (sqft)	Bedrooms	Price
1200	2	300k
2️⃣ Training Set, Validation Set, Test Set

Training set → learns parameters

Validation set → hyperparameter tuning

Test set → final unbiased evaluation

Typical split:

70% Train

15% Validation

15% Test

3️⃣ Model

A mathematical function with learnable parameters.

Example (Linear Regression):

y=wx+b
4️⃣ Loss Function

Measures how wrong the model’s predictions are.

Task	Common Loss Functions
Regression	MSE, MAE, RMSE, Huber
Classification	Cross-Entropy, Log Loss, Hinge Loss
5️⃣ Optimization Algorithm

Minimizes the loss function.

Examples:

Gradient Descent

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Adam, RMSProp

F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix

Use Precision when false positives are costly

Use Recall when false negatives are costly

6. Bias–Variance Tradeoff

High Bias → Underfitting

High Variance → Overfitting

Problem	Solution
Underfitting	Add features, complex model
Overfitting	Regularization, more data, pruning
7. Regularization Techniques

Used to prevent overfitting.

L1 (Lasso) → Feature selection

L2 (Ridge) → Shrinks weights

ElasticNet → Combination of L1 + L2

8. Feature Engineering (Very Important)

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMax)

Polynomial features

Feature selection

9. Data Leakage

Occurs when information from the test set leaks into training.

Example:

Scaling entire dataset before splitting


📌 Always fit preprocessors only on training data.
